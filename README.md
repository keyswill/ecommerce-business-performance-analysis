# E-Commerce Business Performance Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes an e-commerce dataset to understand how sales volume, product performance, and pricing behavior impact overall revenue. The goal is to uncover actionable insights that help business stakeholders make more confident, data-driven decisions instead of relying on assumptions.

The analysis focuses on identifying revenue drivers, inefficiencies, and misleading performance signals within sales data.

## Business Problem
Many e-commerce businesses assume that higher sales volume automatically leads to higher revenue. In practice, this is often not true. Without clear visibility into revenue contribution by product, order behavior, and pricing, decision-makers may prioritize the wrong products or strategies.

This project addresses the lack of clarity around what actually drives revenue performance.

---

## Key Business Questions
- Which products generate the most revenue?
- Does high sales volume correlate with high revenue?
- Are some high-volume products underperforming in revenue?
- How concentrated is revenue across the product catalog?

---

## Data Description
The dataset represents historical e-commerce transaction data and includes information such as:
- Orders and order quantities
- Product details
- Sales and revenue metrics

The data was cleaned and prepared prior to analysis.

---

## Tools Used
- **Excel** for data exploration, analysis, and visualization
- **GitHub** for project documentation and version control

---

## Analysis Approach
The analysis includes:
- Descriptive analysis to understand overall sales and revenue trends
- Diagnostic analysis to compare sales volume versus revenue contribution
- Visualization to highlight patterns, outliers, and concentration effects

The focus is on business interpretation rather than purely technical metrics.

---

## Key Insights
- High sales volume does not always translate to high revenue
- A small subset of products contributes a disproportionate share of total revenue
- Some high-volume products may dilute revenue due to pricing or margins
- Revenue-focused decision-making is more effective than volume-focused strategies

---

## Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset (or representative sample)
- Exploratory and diagnostic analysis
- Business-focused dashboard
- Visualizations highlighting key insights
